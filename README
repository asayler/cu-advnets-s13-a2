Assignment 2
README

A basic series of mininet + Floodlight tutorials and experiments for
the University of Colorado Advanced Networks Class, Spring 2013.

*** Files and Directories ***

a2         - Unmodified copies of the provided base code for the assignment
floodlight - Git sub-module containing a fork of the Floodlight OpenFlow controller
FLOODLOG   - A reference Floodlight log from a known-good run for Step 2
MAGIC      - Short description of the ARP magic used by the controller in Step 2
PROXLOG    - A reference proxy log from a known-good run for Step 2
ptprox.c   - Working copy of the proxy code for Step 2
README     - This file
run.py     - A python script to start mininet with a given topology, start
             the proxy and perform some fake ARP magic for our purposes
RUNLOG     - Dump of a known-good reference mininet session for Step 2
TOPO       - Description of the test topology and policy for Step 2

*** Notes and Issues ***

- The proxy crashes ungracefully after mininet is closed,
  leading to a series of
  "/proc/14340/ns/net: No such file or directory"
  errors at the end of the proxy log file.
- The run.py script fails to clean up its threads when exiting,
  leading to it hanging until the associated python process is
  manually killed
- The AdvNetRouter module in the Floodlight controller occasionally
  throws null pointer exceptions. These do not seem to effect
  functionality.
- Using the names 's0', 'switch0' and perhaps others for switch names
  in the mininet topology specified in run.py leads to a lack of
  communication between all hosts. Maybe a bug in mininet 2.0.0?
