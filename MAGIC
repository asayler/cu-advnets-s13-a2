MAGIC MAC

The MAGIC_MAC and MAGIC_IP addresses are used to signal to the
controller which switch port each host is connected to. In the run.py
file, we manully populate the ARP table for each host instead of
actually relying on real ARP messages. Normally, the controller would
identify which host is connected to which port by snooping the actual
ARP traffic, but since our simulation never generates any ARP traffic,
this is not possible. Instead we make sure that each host sends a
special message to the MAGIC_MAC/MAGIC_IP. The controller watches for
these MAGIC values and uses them to populate its port-to-host
mappings. These mappings are used to routing elsewhere in the
controller code.

I assume we are using the MAGIC method of populating port-to-host
mappings because it is simpler then relying on true ARP message
sniffing, etc.
